title: Google thinks I walked a mile in rain
---

Today morning I saw strange Google Now card saying I am parked almost 3kms away from my home. I started recalling what happened last night.

Yesterday night I was riding a bike on my way from office to home. I was halfway on the way and it started raining. First week of June is time for pre-monsoon showers in Pune, India. Pre-monsoon shower is a local phenomenon. It could be happening on smaller area like a square km. As a result, there was water on road and traffic started moving at snail's place. Last 2.5kms, I was moving at ~5-7kms/hour. I think this where Google start thinking I parked my bike and started walking. Google saw change in speed and made assumption that I am on my way to home, it started raining and I parked my bike and start walking in rain almost 3 kms towards my home.

Lesson learned. Parameters like microclimate could easily create an aberration in behavior and could lead to wrong assumptions.
