I build things.

Began playing with computers at age 13. 

At [VSH Solutions](https://www.vshsolutions.com) we've launched many successful software applications and businesses alongside them which has grown our business as well. 

Throughout my life I've been focused on exploring new technologies and creating meaningful and enjoyable products with them. Now most of my time via [VSH Solutions](https://www.vshsolutions.com) is concentrated on working with companies to continue exploring this passion.
